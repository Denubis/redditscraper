              'Body': u'Ultimately, it\'s an expression of a very right-wing worldview usually. \n\nThe anti-semitism stuff stems from a number of things. The Bible is a big one, as evil Jews become the world leaders under the antichrist during/before Armageddon. So the whole, God\'s chosen, with many who abuse this power motif fuels a lot of the antisemitic stuff, and even inspires the non-religious based hatred. That combined with much higher than average income and achievement level in American Jews, and you\'ll rope in the jealous crowd as well as the anti-bank, anti-rich crowd.\n\nAs for other races, I don\'t know as much. A lot of it is rooted in Nationalism, in the creation of a unified national identity. It is much easier to create a unified identity when everybody is the same ethnicity than if there is more obvious differentiation, and you\'ll note that a lot of places with very strong national identities and high xenophobia are also very homogenic. \n\nOr, you could simplify this all into basically, team-based thinking. People crave similarity and some are more drawn to group-thinking and wanting to be a part of a larger mass. This desire for conformity is easiest with very obvious traits, and things like skin color become easy "teams" to side with.',

I grew up with a (white) kid who was pretty normal. We both had black and latino friends. Just generic middle America. My dad was military and we got shipped out when I was in middle school. \n\nWhen I came back to visit not two or three years later, he had gone American History X on me (although this was a few years before that came out.) He wasn\'t a skinhead, but the whole time I was there, he was complaining about the mexicans and the blacks. \n\nI asked him what the heck was up and when did this happen. His answer was that he was so sick of hearing about slavery and how bad black people had it and how it was "all the white man\'s fault, even though they (insert convoluted logic here)". He felt the civil rights lessons in school were guilt trips, and didn\'t like how the black kids in school talked about it. He thought they were being racist, etc.\n\nI never really hung out with him after that, but according to my mother who talked to his mom every once in a while for a few years after that, it was "just a phase" and he grew out of it.

For the most part it doesn\'t start out with absolute hatred that manifests itself in the radical movement you\'re referring to. This type of hatred is cultivated from an impressionable age. Recruiters to these groups aren\'t much different from gang members or even the guy who tried to get you sign up for a pyramid scheme in college.\n\nThey find the misfits or outcasts. Maybe 14 or 15 year old kids cutting school and sitting out in an abandoned lot smoking cigarettes. These kids don\'t usually have a solid family structure and racism is already kind of sown into their views of life. One day a guy pulls up in a Camaro. He has a shaved head a tattoos up and down his arms. This guy is 22 years old and to productive members of society looks like a total fuck up, but to these kids he looks pretty fucking bad ass. He can also buy beer.\n\nThese kids don\'t fit in anywhere, but this dude invites them to parties. Buys them beer, a pack of smokes, and generally becomes a big brother or father figure they never had. Now they have a sense of identity. They befriend more people in this group. They feel like they belong. So when all of their friends say "hey, we hate the Jews/blacks/gays." They say yeah, we fucking hate them too. Individually, they might be racist, but they might have had a black friend who wasn\'t so bad...except now they\'re part of this group, and they need to prove themselves.\n\nAs time passes they get into rougher and crueler territory. Violence, threats and a lot of other things they would have never done alone are happening because they need to prove themselves. They get married and all their hate group friends are there, even in the wedding. They have kids of their own and start to raise a family. Maybe they want to get out, but where are they going to go? All of their friends are in this hate filled group. They can\'t get a decent job because they didn\'t go to college (filled with a bunch of liberal homos), got a felony for beating a guy to an inch of his life, and have neck tattoos that claim white power (or Kill Whitey, depending on which side they\'re on). The ones that do get out put themselves and their families in physical danger because these are the kinds of people who don\'t take kindly to people turning their backs on them. \n\nSo they end up indoctrinating their kids into this, and the cycle continues.\n\nI don\'t condone any of this, but it really makes me pity the people who get wrapped up in this hate-fueled lifestyle knowing they never had the same chance a lot of us take for granted.',

The ones set in Japan have Japanese characters across the board. Chinese ones have Chinese characters. American ones have American characters.\n\nSure. You CAN put Japanese warlord into a Civil war sim, but I THINK it\'s kinda lame. Think that\'s the only issue here. Wasn\'t the big stink recently about some Polish game not having minorities?

We could use another Harry Potter or something like Kill Bill. Hell I\'d even be more hype for a Twilight reboot or sequel.\n\nJacob & Renesmee adventures sounds more watchable than another 8 hour race scene and racist aliens. At least when Twilight is bad it\'s still funny & bad in a good way. Star Wars is like watching people watching paint dry while a computer renders more shit than you\'ll ever care about for no reason.\nI\'d even say No More Heroes a game for the Wii did better with the idea of "lazer swords" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7qGqG3HxtY  Or if they really wanted to blow ppls minds if they made a goddamned Gundam movie.\n\nPoint is I refuse in anyway to be associated with or dragged into Star Wars.

I'd welcome them here if they play their parts in my country, pay their taxes and do whatever is needed to adapt to our culture. I just try to avoid contacts with them.

Although, I guess I am, because I will try to avoid any unnecessary interaction with someone who is arab.

The only thing that should matter is giving each role to the actor best suited for it. If Boyega was the best man for the role, which he very well could be, perfect! If he\'s in the movie just because there has to be a black guy, well, that\'s a problem in more ways than one.\n\nI\'m not arguing that he is or isn\'t in the movie just because they wanted a leading black character, I\'m simply stating my belief that shoehorning minorities into movies/tv/etc does happen (if it didn\'t why would there be a "token minority" trope), and is a problem. If it was a white guy of course no one would be worried that it happened in TFA,  white guys aren\'t minorities.

              'Body': u'There\'s probably several reasons why they do this, some of them sinister, some of them in common with non-extremist organizations.\n\n-If they\'re outside the mainstream, the people most likely to join them are the ones who aren\'t overly attached to remaining normal (i. e. people who are already outcasts)\n\n\n-Teenagers in general, and outcast teenagers in particular, are more likely than adults or popular teenagers to have a "question the mainstream" attitude towards things, and be more likely to entertain alternate (in this case extremist) narratives.  Relatedly, teenagers are more likely to be searching for identity (which the extremists can provide), whereas adults are more likely to already have one (and to have one that includes "I\'m not literally a nazi" as a non-negotiable point)\n\n-The extremists think of themselves as good guys, and will target prospective members who they think will "benefit" most from joining them (lonely people, in other words)\n\n-They require a high level of commitment, and therefore seek out people who won\'t have any conflicting commitments (i.e. non-extremist friends or family)\n\n-If they\'re doing things that could be reported to the authorities, they\'ll want to pick people who are already wary of the authories, and/or are too young to have a lot of credibility if they do tattle.\n\n-They\'d like to get high-powered middle age professionals if they could, but those people usually do more investigation into the thing they\'re thinking of joining than a lonely teenager, and when they do that they tend not to join.  So the extremists target lonely teenagers instead.\n\n-Alternately, if the group is very hierarchical, they might want to actively *avoid* new members who have enough social authority to overrule existing members.  A successful small businessman might make things uncomfortable for the existing extremist leaders ("Rank be damned!  We\'re doing it my way or no more free catering!"), while a lonely teenager definitely wouldn\'t.\n\n-After a long period of mostly recruiting lonely teenagers, doing so just becomes part of the extremist group\'s institutional culture.  Recruiters seek out potential members who resemble themselves when they joined, and if they started out as lonely teenagers, that\'s who they\'ll seek out.',

              'Body': u'No one can force people to accept something that they don\'t want to. Fortunately, when it comes to females and black people in lead roles, no one here is against either of those things. In fact, I think a lot of us are actually largely in support of those things, but what we don\'t like is for people to make diverse characters just to jerk off about it. While I\'m all for certain tropes being retired, it\'s purely because I don\'t like to see cliches. I have friends that are all different religions, sexual and gender identities, political beliefs, and so on. But my friends laugh if I make jokes about their race, gender, color, and what have you. A lot of feminists in college really turned a lot of them off by being sensitive towards their blackness, their sex change, their horrible stutter, and ironically they were a lot more comfortable with me than the people who complained when I made jokes to (not about) the people they defended and didn\'t know anything about, who they fucking hated. It\'s bigots they can handle, because a bigot expects them to act unlike the way "normal people" do. People that associate actions and deeds not with a person or fictional character, but with an identity, essentially rob them of their individuality. It\'s like the classic Speedy Gonzales example; maybe a decade or so ago, it was decided he was probably racist towards Mexicans, because he wore a sombrero and had an accent. Ironically, he not only had been beloved by most Hispanics since his inception, they call him a "cultural icon" because he defied the stereotypical sleepy dumb Mexican, and was clever, quick, and heroically used his speed to help his people. Since then, Hispanic people have had to petition to be able to see him again, and now when they do sell Speedy Gonzales cartoons, they preface it by saying that his Mexican heritage should be taken as the racist and horribly offensive ideas of yesteryear. Simply put, it\'s the fact that having an overly Mexican identity can be assumed to be racist, in direct defiance of the attitudes of the people he supposedly mocks, that make people come to the conclusion that what Mexicans are proud of is an embarrassment and offensive to our sensibilities to white Americans. \n\nIt\'s that attitude, often from people with good intent and little life experience, that we take issue with. We like female protagonists, but we don\'t like the pretentious notion that any game having one is blowing our mind to show a girl kick ass, or that it\'s a fuck you to the supposedly toxic masculinity that we\'re all about, and we\'re losing our shit over girls doing things. We care about the characters for who they are, while other people seem to care more about what they are',

But whenever a minority or female character is included people accuse it of being "forced diversity" or "affirmative action in video games" or "why did they have to be black/a woman?" or "this is just pandering to whatever crowd" or "what\'s the justification for this character for being part of this demographic?" or "well the series has only had white and male characters in the past and I can\'t believe they\'re changing that".\n\nGG likes to act "well I mean it could go either way" but can you seriously ever think of an example where GG said "ugh, I can\'t believe they\'re making the main character a straight white dude. Classic pandering to \'gamers\'. Seriously, like i\'m fine with white men in video games but i hate it when the devs are forced to put this kind of character in games. And of course all the games journalists are going to give it high scores just because the color of his skin". That sounds ridiculous, right?',

              'Body': u"I think human beings are wired for racism as a quick survival mechanism; i.e. us and not us; our tribe and not our tribe.\n\nMy evidence for this comes partly from racial humor.  In every culture, there are jokes about a different race or culture.  For instance, I grew up in SoCal learning Polack Jokes.  The first time I spent a few days in Central California I heard the same jokes told by Hispanics but told about the Portuguese.  Portiggy jokes.\n\nAs an adult, I observed the Chinese telling similar jokes about the white Americans, the Japanese telling similar jokes about the Filipinos, etc.\n\nFor some reason, everyone needs to identify with one group and put down another group.  I know part of it might be genetically inherited, but then my white father was a bigot towards blacks and I never was. On vacations to the South, I didn't care if the water fountain was for whites or blacks, and I got spanked for it. So the bigotry isn't tied to race, but it's a strong drive in us to identify with one group and shun or punish another.  It's a baser human drive, and can be overcome through experience.\n\nMy father changed after a black man saved his life one night; they became friends.  I always wonder who he missed knowing all those years before.  ",

Or something. I have no doubt they\'d treat me very different if we\'d met under different circumstances.\n\nBut people get all \'white supremacist\' for a bunch of different reasons.\n\nI think with younger people today, they probably don\'t see much of the kind of overt, undeniable, institutionalised racism that used to be more obvious, but they *do* see a Black man in the Whitehouse, super-rich \'privileged\' Black celebs, etc. Yet they still hear about "White privilege" (a phrase guaranteed to piss people off) and that non-White groups are discriminated against.\n\nCombine this with limited personal experience, poor capacity for empathy, and an appealing ideology which recasts them from \'the villain\' (a lot of people see \'white privilege\' as an accusation) to "the *real* oppressed minority", and there is a kind of (flawed, ignorant) logic to their thinking.\n\nPeople love an ideology that frames them as the "poor, wronged victim." \n\nUsually they don\'t even *really* consider themselves \'racist\'; they they\'re "just being honest", or something. And 90% of them kind of aren\'t *truly* \'racist\' (in a way); *if* you can cut thru the bullshit rhetoric, they\'ll eventually treat you (regardless of race) as an individual. Very few people *truly* believe that ultimately, *all* [insert race] people are [insert stereotype], in spite of the reasonable, non-stereotype-fitting person in front of them. (of course this won\'t change their mind; you\'re just an exception to the stereotype, and now proof that they\'re "not really racist")\n\nIts all pretty weird and contradictory. I don\'t wanna sound like I\'m excusing people\'s moronic belief systems, but I think \'calling out\' people as \'white supremacists\' or having \'white privilege\' is rarely helpful, and usually just reinforces their beliefs. I hate to be all \'peace and love\' but reasonable, non-preachy dialogue, is more likely to make people question their beliefs.',

I was mad this bullshit was overshadowing the Hotline Bling video dropping but I guess there\'s 3 70\'s movies I didn\'t see that are supposed to be the ones people actually want to see more of.\n\nThat\'s a really bad naming system.  Like if you don\'t follow it how would anyone that went to a theater that day KNOW there were others?  You go in, "episode 1" you see it think "that\'s trash I\'m never watching that again" and go on with your life.  Plus there\'s like 80 bajillion Star Wars things so you CAN\'T keep track of what you\'ve seen or haven\'t.',

This differs because the complaints are about a specific movie which although it seemingly gives a backseat to white men doesn\'t really alter the balance in movies at large. Basically the reaction to this trailer is essentially the straw man that GG likes to pretend "SJWs" believe about diversity.\n\n> In what ways are the two types of criticism the same?\n\nIn ways too trivial to be interesting to discuss.\n\n> Do you oppose or support one of these types of criticism? Both? Neither? Why?\n\nIt\'s hard to support criticism about diversity that isn\'t self-aware enough to see the broader picture. Doubly so when the proponents seem to be sexist, racist douchenozzles.\n\nIn general I\'m down with criticism of representation of women and minorities in movies in general.',

To use another analogy, if you go to tea party rally and hold up an "Obama is a secret Muslim" sign not because you really believe it but because you think its funny how it pisses off liberals, what\'s the difference?

The point of that whole damn story was that even the best of us have a Dark Side. There is no such thing as people who are evil or good. That was why Yoda told Luke to beware anger, fear, and aggression, and when Yoda said the cave was "strong in the dark side," Luke asked him what was in there, and his response was "only what you take with you." The cave was strong in the dark side because Luke brought the dark side in their with him, as evidenced by Luke finding his "father" in there, breaking the mask, and seeing, guess what, himself. Finally, at the end of the trilogy, Luke is saved from himself by his renunciation of violence. He throws down his lightsaber, and with that act, declares himself to be a Jedi, a guardian of, guess what, peace and justice. Very Taoist. He met force with Non-Force, capital letters there intended. He met violence with nonviolence. He met war with peace.\n\n> "How do you claim to be a part of the Star Wars fandom and somehow miss the entire point of all of the movies?!" \n\nIndeed.',

There is a difference between objecting to the themes or content of a work, and objecting to the quality of a work, even if the issue of quality relates to the themes. \n\nFor example, if someone tells me that they have they have a new Christian Rock group they want to show me, I expect it will suck. But I have a lot of music saved on my computer by Christian groups writing about Christian themes, all of which I really enjoy. The difference is pretty simple. When I hear the words "Christian Rock" I expect to hear shitty music that sacrifices musical quality for purity of message, I expect the message to be about as subtle as a brick to the face, and I expect it\'s popularity among it\'s fans to be driven primarily by a mixture of in-group loyalty, and an almost sad desperation for media that panders very specifically to their world view. Not just media compatible with it- media that checks all the right boxes for them as much as possible. I expect this because I have decades of experience watching this social dynamic take place. Crappy music gets promoted in Christian Rock circles for ideological and tribalist reasons, and good music with Christian themes is rejected for insufficient ideological purity. At this point if I hear that a band is popular with or caters to the Christian Rock crowd, I expect the worst because that\'s what history has taught me. This is in spite of all the Christian music on my hard drive. It\'s not the themes that are the problem- it\'s the crappy community and it\'s neuroses. A Christian Rock fan might try to dismiss this paragraph by calling me anti Christian- I can virtually guarantee at least some would do that- but that doesn\'t mean a lot to me because that\'s pretty clearly as defensive reflex designed to preserve self image in the face of on point criticism. So that\'s their baggage. \n\nA lot of people see feminist engagement with media as embodying the same neuroses. You\'ve linked some people who plainly do. They say so quite clearly. \n\nAnd you\'ve done the standard. You\'ve erased that portion if their argument and re-characterized it in accurately in irdervto avoid engaging with it. And you\'ve sought out outrage peddling media outlets that professionally nutpick and attribute the results to society at large, to ensure that you can assure yourself that your re-characterization is an accurate reflection of what those you\'re criticizing *really* believe, so who cares if you had to put words into people\'s mouths to get there. \n\nIt\'s particularly a shame because there are enormous analogies to be the anti feminist response to feminist friendly media, and the feminist response to male gaze friendly media. Both involve making up bullshit objections to something benign and trying to justify them via incredibly questionable and unreasonably hostile arm chair psychology about both the way the media was created, and the reactions of the intended audience. Both arguments have the same strengths, and also the same weaknesses. But that\'s a grown up conversation that isn\'t happening with people who read the Mary Sue. ',

It plays into the need for losers to feel morally superior to some no-name idiot on the Internet.  The pathetic clickbait "progressive" media took no time whatsoever to look into this and, surprise to no one, has now made asses of themselves by taking trolls seriously and deeply analyzing what trolls have to say.  The one unfortunate part is that they\'re so hopelessly inept that they\'ll never even realize their blunder.  The Guardian even called them "trolls," but they meant it in the clueless, Pulitzer Prize-winning media sort of way where the definition is "some jerk on the Internet."  So that\'s why GamerGate doesn\'t care about condemning a few trolls from 4chan who weren\'t sincere to begin with and managed to bait our enemies into once again showing how pathetic their reporting skills are.',

The thing is "why are they linking us together, we aren\'t related", nothing else. This is an important distinction that you\'re not making.\n\nRead the comments on my links and yours and you\'ll find plenty of people condemning the tag.\n\n> What\'s notable to me is that this criticism being levied at the Star Wars film, that it gives insufficient representation to white men, embodies many elements of what GamerGate supporters and many others claim to hate about feminist or "SJW" criticism. It carries a seemingly obsessive focus on gender and race, rather than on "objective" criteria like acting and cinematography, or more politically neutral questions like "is it fun to watch?" It\'s an accusation made on moral or social grounds rooted in a political agenda. It constitutes social pressure (including a declared boycott) being applied to studios in an attempt to get them to change their film, remove problematic elements, or otherwise prevent them from making the film that they want to make. As far as I can tell, by whatever standards GGers have used in the past to justify accusing "SJWs" of attempting censorship, this is absolutely an attempt at censorship.\n\nThing is, the whole idea is so fucking stupid that we didn\'t even get to the "it\'s an attempt at censorship" because it\'s obviously stupid even _before_ that argument.\n\nAnd yeah, the tag seems to be a giant troll.\n\n> In what ways is this criticism being made against the Star Wars film different from the feminist criticism that typically gets made regarding sexism/racism/etc. in video games, comics, films, and other media?\n\nI can\'t believe I\'m saying this, but even the worst of feminist criticism is usually less dumb, except for _very_ special circumstances.\n\n> In what ways are the two types of criticism the same?\n\nEverything you\'ve said, obsessive focus on irrelevant factors with a pro-censorious streak.\n\n> Do you oppose or support one of these types of criticism? Both? Neither? Why?\n\nI oppose both. You have already stated the reasons.\n\n> If #BoycottStarWarsVII was a hashtag started by a feminist in anger over the poster giving too much prominence to a white male character rather than black or female ones, how do you think GamerGate or KiA would have reacted?\n\nThere would be more posts and we would talk about it more because it\'s closer to one of GG\'s "focus" points. Everything else would remain the same -- GG is already condemning the hell out of this tag and disassociating itself from it.',

It\'s a minor quibble, but Fury Road actually suffered for it\'s insertion of feminist themes into the movie, specifically when they\'d waste time- brevity is the soul of an action movie, most of all one that is effectively a car chase splayed across the movie\'s running time- to divert from the plot to have the camera focus on something completely frivilous, like scrawl on the wall asking *who* killed the world. \n\n\nIt\'s the subtler things- Imortan Joe wearing a chest coat thing that was clear plastic meant to press his body into an ideal 6 pack, his breathing apparatus turned into something a bit more menacing- that work a bit better. \n\n\nIf Star Wars does the same thing where they intentionally supplant the plot to give quips and take up screen time to literally tell the audience their message, it\'ll be the same problem all over again.

I\'ve seen things like the director asking for random people resulting in the casting call being for white people only.

Here I am thinking that all the white supremacists that have signed on to the hashtag joke are serious and find out that there is nothing to worry about because 4Chan started it as a joke and #blackjedisnatter is an over reaction because racism is only as serious as you allow it to be. Am I getting that right! So 4chan, knowing that race is America's red meat issue, yelled racism in a country obsessed with it to see what happened. \n\nI am so impressed. LOL",

Yet, when the pressure comes from a tiny number of 4chan Nazis rather than from a tiny number of ranty feminists, they seem not to be particularly bothered by it. Why could that be?",

              'Body': u'Take it in context. People dislike the idea of casting for \'diversity\' rather than talent. It\'s not that a white character was meant to star in the film but was replaced, but rather that the directors and producers would never even consider a white male protagonist because it\'s not diverse enough or something, which shows where their priorities lie. This is backed-up by derogatory comments that the director, JJ Abrams, has previously made [about white people](http://www.slashfilm.com/star-wars-7-racially-diverse/):\n> "you look around that room and you see the whitest fucking room in the history of time. Its just unbelievably white. And I just thought, we\u2019re casting this show and we have an opportunity to do anything we want, why not cast the show with actors of color?"\n\nReverse the races and try to imagine him getting away with saying something like that. I can\'t prove any of this but there is evidence to suggest that the exclusion of white male actors in the protagonist role for the sake of \'diversity\' and \'representation\' may have been deliberate like I\'ve shown above. Listen to what the president of Lucasfilm [says at the end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HGZPBDuDs). That\'s what I meant by "deliberate replacement", should\'ve been more clear.',

I\'ll skip the TL;DR and cut to the chase, these guys are pants-on-head retarded who just spout the same boring slogans and empty mantras. (Genophilia also wants to save the white race but has a slav in their avatar lel) So yeah, the goal of this stunt was the same as any other /pol/ op- create a massive controversy via trolling so a few people will see the core message and go "maybe he\'s got a point." I mean if you get 1 out of a thousand people, that can be pretty good when you\'re getting exposure in the millions. \n\nThe reason, of course, Josh is retarded is because the second part of this kind of op requires following up on it, which the White Rabbit crew never fucking does. When we pushed the #Cuckservative meme pretty hard, we made sure to have a bunch of TRS articles explaining what we meant, trying to convert basic-bitch Neocons to paleoconservatism. It actually got us a massive popularity boost and we made long-term gains from it. The White Rabbit crew doesn\'t do that, they just throw shit out there and never follow up on it. So to be afraid that they\'ll recruit through this sort of thing shows a complete lack of understanding on how these things work.  ',

Guh, people get so offended because they can't understand le edgy humour.\n\nEveryone else: You know racists don't spend all day throwing darts at pictures of MLK, they make the exact same jokes on tired stereotypes of black people. Infact continually focussing on a person's skin just because they're a POC is in itself racist. You're racist.\n\nReddit: Ha, you still don't get the *joke*. Anyway, how come everyone's always allowed to make jokes about white people. Black people commit 99% of crime and that's a FACT.\n\nEveryone else: Please shut your racist ass up.\n\n----------\n\nad infinitum",

I was in South America when the Star Wars shit blew up, and I didn\'t care then, and I don\'t care now. I don\'t think I\'m goin\'.\n\n*Dennis:* I loved Star Wars when I was a kid, but I\'ve gotta agree, it\'s just not my cup of tea anymore. \n\n*Charlie:* Well, I\'m excited. Such a shame Mac won\'t be alive to see it. \n\n*Dennis:* I actually saw a hashtag called "Boycott Star Wars". Maybe you and I should make and sell T-Shirts, Frank, that say that so we can capitalize on all the people who are too cool for it, like us. \n\n*Dee:* Woah woah woah, that hashtag exists only because a group of evil racist asswipes are pissed that there\'s no white male lead!\n\n*Frank (to Charlie):* What the hell\'s a hashtag?\n\n*Dennis:* Well, then we can sell to the racists too! We\'ll get two groups of people!\n\n*Frank:* I don\'t understand a thing that\'s going on, but I do know how to market to racists!\n\n*Dennis:* Great! Then I\'ll get started on the T-Shirts, you start getting preorders in!\n\n*Frank:* What the hell\'s a preorder?\n\n*Dennis:* Don\'t worry about it, we\'ll deal with that later... In the meantime, should we call an ambulance for Mac? He\'s still out. \n\n*Charlie:* Nah, just pour some frozen vodka on him, that\'ll wake him right up. \n\n*Dennis:* Charlie, alcohol DOESN\'T FREEZE! Look, Frank, so long as we don\'t sacrifice our own values in this, I\'m fine. I love all races equally. \n\n*Dee:* Yeah, you love banging all races equally...\n\n*Frank:* Of course! So do I! We\'ll sell to them and leave it at that. \n\n*Frank and Dennis Join the KKK*',

You know, those people who\'s culture and philosophy was heavily borrowed from to make the original trilogy?

It came across as if he passed over the best actors for the roles for lesser actors who happened to be PoC.\n\nWhy didn\'t he just say he cast the best actors for the roles and what we have are the best actors.  I don\'t think the quote needed to be said and I would feel dehumanised if I was the actor playing the role and the director came out and said it was a pity casting.  No, not upset, angry.  People want equality, not charity.\n\nI am not sure, I think the USA has a disgusting fascination with racism and prejudism, perhaps not being from the USA makes it feel uncomfortable to watch it from the outside looking in, it is awkward because when I see Morgan Freeman, James Earl Jones or whichever actor on screen I don\'t see a black actor, I just see an actor, kick-ass actors.  To be constantly pointing out someone\'s skin colour or ethnicity to me is racist because if you truly believe in equality you treat people irrespective of their race or pigmentation equally, it is not a state of expression but a state of mind, a state of acceptance.  I don\'t refer to my white friends as white, I don\'t refer to my black friends as black, I don\'t refer to my Asian friends as brown, I just refer to them as my friends.\n\nJust hire the best people for the roles.
