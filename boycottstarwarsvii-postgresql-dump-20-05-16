They've repurposed old white supremacy artwork and slogans then melded them with Star Wars publicity pics and screenshots from the trailers.\n\nSo far they've managed to elicit outrage articles from [Salon](http://www.salon.com/2015/10/20/starring_donald_trump_as_darth_vader_anti_star_wars_white_supremacists_and_tea_party_voters_speak_the_same_language/) and [The Mary Sue](http://www.themarysue.com/boycott-star-wars-vii-because-why-again/).  These are exactly the kinds of articles they *want* and the outrage has gotten the hashtag to the top of Twitter trending.  By the 4chan playbook, this op has been very successful.\n\nI don't have links to the spawning threads, but now that it's done, they're happy to admit it.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/The_Extrange/status/656225411773300736\n\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/CRtdl17XIAATZU8.png\n\nhttps://twitter.com/4CHANPRESIDENT/status/656219766319902720\n\nhttps://twitter.com/4CHANPRESIDENT/status/656215093672329216\n\nEdit: Here's a [Vox article](https://www.vox.com/2015/10/19/9571309/star-wars-boycott) on the subject, and the associated [Storify](https://storify.com/genevievekoski/how-boycottstarwarsvii-started) that shows the 2 primaries who got the ball rolling.	t5_33oia

3pgf2m	littledude23	\N	There's been a small bit of controversy lately surrounding the upcoming film *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*, relating to how women and black people are portrayed and represented in the film (or at least in the official promotional materials that have been released). But this time, the complaint is basically that the women and/or black people have *too much* representation, at the cost of giving too little prominence to white, male characters. Some of the drama is documented (and of course, mocked) in /r/BestOfOutrageCulture [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/BestOfOutrageCulture/comments/3pcdbo/i_just_feel_like_men_are_losing_their_shit_women/) and [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/BestOfOutrageCulture/comments/3pdebq/star_wars_the_outrage_awakens_smorgasbord_ehh_i/), and in /r/SubredditDrama [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3p9z7h/argument_in_rmovies_about_star_wars_casting/). But there's been some buzz outside of reddit as well; the hashtag #BoycottStarWarsVII popped up on Twitter, eliciting comment from outlets like [The Mary Sue](http://www.themarysue.com/boycott-star-wars-vii-because-why-again/), [Salon](http://www.salon.com/2015/10/19/racists_threaten_to_boycott_star_wars_vii_because_it_promotes_white_genocide_apparently/), and [The Hollywood Reporter](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/boycott-star-wars-vii-movement-833102), among others.\n\nWhat's notable to me is that this criticism being levied at the Star Wars film, that it gives insufficient representation to white men, embodies many elements of what GamerGate supporters and many others claim to hate about feminist or "SJW" criticism. It carries a seemingly obsessive focus on gender and race, rather than on "objective" criteria like acting and cinematography, or more politically neutral questions like "is it fun to watch?" It's an accusation made on moral or social grounds rooted in a political agenda. It constitutes social pressure (including a declared boycott) being applied to studios in an attempt to get them to change their film, remove problematic elements, or otherwise prevent them from making the film that they want to make. As far as I can tell, by whatever standards GGers have used in the past to justify accusing "SJWs" of attempting censorship, this is absolutely an attempt at censorship.\n\nAnd yet I haven't heard a single word from GamerGaters decrying this criticism. The only post I've seen in KiA on this topic is [this one](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3pf00a/ethics_a_whole_three_people_tweet/), and it sides *against* one of the outlets that have criticized the backlash. As a matter of fact, some of the criticism against the film actually sound a lot like what GGers have been saying over the past year, particularly the anger towards "SJWs" and political correctness, and possessiveness over parts of popular culture. If any GGer anywhere has pushed back against the boycotters and other complainants for being moral authoritarians or trying to censor the film, I haven't seen it.\n\nDiscussion questions:\n\n* In what ways is this criticism being made against the Star Wars film different from the feminist criticism that typically gets made regarding sexism/racism/etc. in video games, comics, films, and other media?\n\n* In what ways are the two types of criticism the same?\n\n* Do you oppose or support one of these types of criticism? Both? Neither? Why?\n\n* If #BoycottStarWarsVII was a hashtag started by a feminist in anger over the poster giving too much prominence to a white male character rather than black or female ones, how do you think GamerGate or KiA would have reacted?\n\nEDIT: A lot of this also applies to the [conservative backlash](http://www.cinemablend.com/television/Watch-Fox-News-Slam-Captain-America-Targeting-Conservatives-93287.html) against [Captain America](http://comicsalliance.com/conservatives-vs-captain-america/), if you'd rather talk about that instead.	t5_3441a

3plki0	CollumMcJingleballs	\N	>Hollywood movies these days are more a liberal political statement than an actual cultural creation.\n\n>Makes me sick, this movie clearly alienates its main audience (white kids), the lead character that gets shit done is a women, the focus of her affection is a black dude, the evil guys are white.\n\n>Fuck you hollywood, trying to make young white kids feel insecure about themselves and promoting interest in black males by young white girls, which only exacerbates the insecurity already felt by young white boys, that are losing their place in the world. \n\n>Then, out of frustration, some will start shooting up schools  \n\n[link](https://np.reddit.com/r/european/comments/3phss2/boycottstarwarsvii_where_villains_are_white/cw6tst0)\n\n---\n\n- Director's Cut Extra Features\n\n>The majority of new main Actors in the film are from Europe I noticed. As far as the 'white genocide message'... I don't seem to think so.\n\n>Now, do I believe Abrams deliberately made the cast 'multi-cultural' simply for no other reason than to be politically correct? Absolutely. And he didn't just increase diversity, he ramped it up a few notches. That's what rubs me the wrong way about it. Race isn't supposed matter to liberals, except when it always does simply to show everyone how to be overly PC.\n\n[link](https://np.reddit.com/r/european/comments/3phss2/boycottstarwarsvii_where_villains_are_white/cw6hpv9)\n\n---\n\n>I don't now about Star Wars, but I dropped Fear the Walking Dead after the second episode. I'm sorry but I just can't enjoy the show when in America, a mainly white country, they try to present the next situation:\n\n>- The stepfather is a Paki, replacing the bad white exhusband that doesn't help his family.\n\n>- The mother is a white "strong independent womyn", made explicity clear when the cop asked the Paki if he always let's her handle things when she busts in like she is a god that doesn't need to follow hospital procedures or the law, obviously the Paki has to show how emmasculated he is and say that she is better at it.\n\n>- The daughter is also white, but guess what, her magnificient sensitive boyfriend is black and acts like her moral compass.\n\n>- The son, white, is a junkie.\n\n>- All cops and law related people that are shown are black, the whole hospital's staff are blacks and brown if men, only white if women.\n\n>- The first zombie of the series is a woman, she is white.\n\n>- The second junkie we see is a man, and of course, had to be white.\n\n>Basically, all decent educated men that appear = black/brown. If they are junkies or they suck they are white. And of course, women are strong independynt womyn and they are all white.\n\n>I don't know, it's like watching a movie whose plot is located in Nigeria but all of them happen to be white. Wtf? Can't watch that shit, it's garbage from minute 1. At least, if women were also black, you could say that it's located in a mainly black neighborhood, but nope, all white.\n\n[link](https://np.reddit.com/r/european/comments/3phss2/boycottstarwarsvii_where_villains_are_white/cw6phsg)\n\nAh, Star Wars Outrage. 6.5 Million in IMAX sales alone. Enjoy your showings, gentlemen.	t5_33k31

cw93z0h	TheSJWRedditDeserves	\N	Yeah, now that I think about it the black man in the first series was a cowardly traitor.

cw5zfi2	snigwich	\N	JJ Abrams is on record as stating that he did it because he thought Star Wars was too white and too masculine. It's a direct attempt to undermine our culture and it also goes against a purposeful stylistic choice of George Lucas. Lucas purposefully chose white British actors for the first 6 Star Wars films because that was his vision for the universe.\n\nIt's a big deal. Star Wars is a pillar of millennial culture and JJ Abrams jewed it up because how dare you be white and male.	t5_2rd2l

cw6dts7	dudebromarxist	\N	I saw another 4chan "trolling op" a few weeks back called #pissforequality, in which they made a bunch of sockpuppet Twitter accounts, uploaded pictures taken from some piss fetish website of women wetting themselves, then contacted the media claiming they'd "duped feminists into publically pissing themselves in the name of equality". \n\nExcept there was a minor problem - Every single post by a "feminist" supposedly pissing themselves was a sockpuppet. lul. This meant the usual band of merry MRAs and anti-feminists were sitting around patting themselves on the back for pretending that feminists wet themselves. Woot.\n\n\nThese "trolling ops" basically amount to:\n\n- make a dumb internet hashtag\n- get ignored or otherwise met with general apathy/mild disgust\n- declare victory\n\nThis one actually seems to have been picked up by a few liberal blogs though, so I guess that makes it an even bigger success by their usually low standards.	t5_33oia

How do you think KiA/GG would have reacted if it was a feminist making the gender/race-flipped version of that criticism (you know what I mean) against the Star Wars film? I ask because this:\n\n> we didn't even get to the "it's an attempt at censorship" because it's obviously stupid even before that argument.\n\nrings somewhat hollow to me. GGers frequently declare that they're opposed to this sort of censorship or moral authoritarianism or cultural invasion or whatever in tech and geek spaces.

I have canadian friends, used to have black friends, asians, latinos and even one or two arabs I was ok with. Although, I guess I am, because I will try to avoid any unnecessary interaction with someone who is arab.

If it's anything like that, SJWs demanding things are just like any gamer demanding something.\n\nIf you can't do this, there's really nothing to this but quite obvious reactionary ideology and fear mongering.

cw5k8s7	Uglycannibal	\N	Ultimately, it's an expression of a very right-wing worldview usually. \n\nThe anti-semitism stuff stems from a number of things. The Bible is a big one, as evil Jews become the world leaders under the antichrist during/before Armageddon. So the whole, God's chosen, with many who abuse this power motif fuels a lot of the antisemitic stuff, and even inspires the non-religious based hatred. That combined with much higher than average income and achievement level in American Jews, and you'll rope in the jealous crowd as well as the anti-bank, anti-rich crowd.\n\nAs for other races, I don't know as much. A lot of it is rooted in Nationalism, in the creation of a unified national identity. It is much easier to create a unified identity when everybody is the same ethnicity than if there is more obvious differentiation, and you'll note that a lot of places with very strong national identities and high xenophobia are also very homogenic. \n\nOr, you could simplify this all into basically, team-based thinking. People crave similarity and some are more drawn to group-thinking and wanting to be a part of a larger mass. This desire for conformity is easiest with very obvious traits, and things like skin color become easy "teams" to side with.	t5_2sokd

The point of that whole damn story was that even the best of us have a Dark Side. There is no such thing as people who are evil or good. That was why Yoda told Luke to beware anger, fear, and aggression, and when Yoda said the cave was "strong in the dark side," Luke asked him what was in there, and his response was "only what you take with you." The cave was strong in the dark side because Luke brought the dark side in their with him, as evidenced by Luke finding his "father" in there, breaking the mask, and seeing, guess what, himself. Finally, at the end of the trilogy, Luke is saved from himself by his renunciation of violence. He throws down his lightsaber, and with that act, declares himself to be a Jedi, a guardian of, guess what, peace and justice. Very Taoist. He met force with Non-Force, capital letters there intended. He met violence with nonviolence.

I'll skip the TL;DR and cut to the chase, these guys are pants-on-head retarded who just spout the same boring slogans and empty mantras. (Genophilia also wants to save the white race but has a slav in their avatar lel) So yeah, the goal of this stunt was the same as any other /pol/ op- create a massive controversy via trolling so a few people will see the core message and go "maybe he's got a point." I mean if you get 1 out of a thousand people, that can be pretty good when you're getting exposure in the millions. \n\nThe reason, of course, Josh is retarded is because the second part of this kind of op requires following up on it, which the White Rabbit crew never fucking does. When we pushed the #Cuckservative meme pretty hard, we made sure to have a bunch of TRS articles explaining what we meant, trying to convert basic-bitch Neocons to paleoconservatism. It actually got us a massive popularity boost and we made long-term gains from it. The White Rabbit crew doesn't do that, they just throw shit out there and never follow up on it.

It's a minor quibble, but Fury Road actually suffered for it's insertion of feminist themes into the movie, specifically when they'd waste time- brevity is the soul of an action movie, most of all one that is effectively a car chase splayed across the movie's running time- to divert from the plot to have the camera focus on something completely frivilous, like scrawl on the wall asking *who* killed the world. \n\n\nIt's the subtler things- Imortan Joe wearing a chest coat thing that was clear plastic meant to press his body into an ideal 6 pack, his breathing apparatus turned into something a bit more menacing- that work a bit better. \n\n\nIf Star Wars does the same thing where they intentionally supplant the plot to give quips and take up screen time to literally tell the audience their message, it'll be the same problem all over again. 	t5_3441a

A lot complaints about Boyega were part of a larger backlash against Hollywood "shoehorning" (read: representing) minorities into roles. If it was a white guy, these particular people would probably be less likely to complain about it. They'd probably more quickly realize and accept that the Empire must have started taking non-clone soldiers.	t5_2qi4s

It came across as if he passed over the best actors for the roles for lesser actors who happened to be PoC.\n\nWhy didn't he just say he cast the best actors for the roles and what we have are the best actors.  I don't think the quote needed to be said and I would feel dehumanised if I was the actor playing the role and the director came out and said it was a pity casting.  No, not upset, angry.  People want equality, not charity.\n\nI am not sure, I think the USA has a disgusting fascination with racism and prejudism, perhaps not being from the USA makes it feel uncomfortable to watch it from the outside looking in, it is awkward because when I see Morgan Freeman, James Earl Jones or whichever actor on screen I don't see a black actor, I just see an actor, kick-ass actors.  To be constantly pointing out someone's skin colour or ethnicity to me is racist because if you truly believe in equality you treat people irrespective of their race or pigmentation equally, it is not a state of expression but a state of mind, a state of acceptance.  I don't refer to my white friends as white, I don't refer to my black friends as black, I don't refer to my Asian friends as brown, I just refer to them as my friends.\n\nJust hire the best people for the roles.

cw5vm2n	gchames	\N	No one can force people to accept something that they don't want to. Fortunately, when it comes to females and black people in lead roles, no one here is against either of those things. In fact, I think a lot of us are actually largely in support of those things, but what we don't like is for people to make diverse characters just to jerk off about it. While I'm all for certain tropes being retired, it's purely because I don't like to see cliches. I have friends that are all different religions, sexual and gender identities, political beliefs, and so on. But my friends laugh if I make jokes about their race, gender, color, and what have you. A lot of feminists in college really turned a lot of them off by being sensitive towards their blackness, their sex change, their horrible stutter, and ironically they were a lot more comfortable with me than the people who complained when I made jokes to (not about) the people they defended and didn't know anything about, who they fucking hated. It's bigots they can handle, because a bigot expects them to act unlike the way "normal people" do. People that associate actions and deeds not with a person or fictional character, but with an identity, essentially rob them of their individuality. It's like the classic Speedy Gonzales example; maybe a decade or so ago, it was decided he was probably racist towards Mexicans, because he wore a sombrero and had an accent. Ironically, he not only had been beloved by most Hispanics since his inception, they call him a "cultural icon" because he defied the stereotypical sleepy dumb Mexican, and was clever, quick, and heroically used his speed to help his people. Since then, Hispanic people have had to petition to be able to see him again, and now when they do sell Speedy Gonzales cartoons, they preface it by saying that his Mexican heritage should be taken as the racist and horribly offensive ideas of yesteryear. Simply put, it's the fact that having an overly Mexican identity can be assumed to be racist, in direct defiance of the attitudes of the people he supposedly mocks, that make people come to the conclusion that what Mexicans are proud of is an embarrassment and offensive to our sensibilities to white Americans. \n\nIt's that attitude, often from people with good intent and little life experience, that we take issue with. We like female protagonists, but we don't like the pretentious notion that any game having one is blowing our mind to show a girl kick ass, or that it's a fuck you to the supposedly toxic masculinity that we're all about, and we're losing our shit over girls doing things. We care about the characters for who they are, while other people seem to care more about what they are	t5_33726

cw6z6nc	BigChief014	\N	Take it in context. People dislike the idea of casting for 'diversity' rather than talent. It's not that a white character was meant to star in the film but was replaced, but rather that the directors and producers would never even consider a white male protagonist because it's not diverse enough or something, which shows where their priorities lie. This is backed-up by derogatory comments that the director, JJ Abrams, has previously made [about white people](http://www.slashfilm.com/star-wars-7-racially-diverse/):\n> "you look around that room and you see the whitest fucking room in the history of time. Its just unbelievably white. And I just thought, we’re casting this show and we have an opportunity to do anything we want, why not cast the show with actors of color?"\n\nReverse the races and try to imagine him getting away with saying something like that. I can't prove any of this but there is evidence to suggest that the exclusion of white male actors in the protagonist role for the sake of 'diversity' and 'representation' may have been deliberate like I've shown above. Listen to what the president of Lucasfilm [says at the end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HGZPBDuDs). That's what I meant by "deliberate replacement", should've been more clear.	t5_33726

The ones set in Japan have Japanese characters across the board. Chinese ones have Chinese characters. American ones have American characters.\n\nSure. You CAN put Japanese warlord into a Civil war sim, but I THINK it's kinda lame. Think that's the only issue here. Wasn't the big stink recently about some Polish game not having minorities?

cw5myl6	lordofallshit	\N	lol, gamergate has always not cared about whether diversity was there or not. the whole position is, we dont care if something is diverse. we just want to know, is it good? is it a good game? is it a good movie? we want someone to be able to make a game where everyone is white if they want. we want someone to be able to make a game where everyone is black if they so choose. forced diversity is bullshit. however if someone creating art wants a diverse cast, then awesome its up to the creator.\n\n\ngamergate has only ever cared whether something is good or not and opposed people being bullied into changes because of "diversity for diversity's sake".	t5_33726

I get it, you want representation fine, but NOT EVERYTHING NEEDS TO BE LIKE THAT. SJWs push this shit not realizing that if they get their way, everything is going to be the same bland crap checking off the same fucking diversity quota checklist.](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3mayu8/assassins_creed_syndicate_to_offer_the_series/cvdi68p)\n\nIt's weird how that member of GG was talking about a "bullshit political agenda" instead of whether the game was good or not.

cw5sshw	Artravus	\N	**ALERT! IMPORTANT SENTENCE: I'm completely fine with Boyega being in the movie.** Make sure you've read my last sentence before reading further. Read it again. Did you read it? Really? Okay, I'll move on.\n\nPutting minorities in movies just to "represent" them is the exact same thing as shoehorning them in just to satisfy overly aggressive "activists". The only thing that should matter is giving each role to the actor best suited for it. If Boyega was the best man for the role, which he very well could be, perfect! If he's in the movie just because there has to be a black guy, well, that's a problem in more ways than one.\n\nI'm not arguing that he is or isn't in the movie just because they wanted a leading black character, I'm simply stating my belief that shoehorning minorities into movies/tv/etc does happen (if it didn't why would there be a "token minority" trope), and is a problem. If it was a white guy of course no one would be worried that it happened in TFA,  white guys aren't minorities. People just don't want the quality of a movie they care so much about lowered for such a silly reason. 	t5_2qi4s

cw6fcc1	Clumpy	\N	4chan's "ironic" racism is more like being a racist in one sense, and thinking that you're being "ironic" by exaggerating that racism into more dramatic white supremacy. They don't actually parody or comment on a viewpoint; they just mislead the person looking at the account as to where they're *coming* from with that viewpoint, which is a pretty clear artifact of the "Anon" structure.\n\nBut in this case there's a clear association with KiA/4chan stuff if you look at the accounts making these arguments on Reddit. And they post the same majority anxiety garbage in friendly arenas.	t5_33oia
cw6tnff	wanderingbishop	\N	Y'know, the most amusing thing about this is that it requires you to ignore the time that GENERAL Lando Calrissian led the rebel assault on the 2nd death star. Granted he wasn't a MAIN main character, but Star Wars wouldn't be Star Wars without Billy Dee Williams	t5_33oia

cw5nket	backinohio	\N	I heard a former klan member and recruiter speak about this on a podcast. For the most part it doesn't start out with absolute hatred that manifests itself in the radical movement you're referring to. This type of hatred is cultivated from an impressionable age. Recruiters to these groups aren't much different from gang members or even the guy who tried to get you sign up for a pyramid scheme in college.\n\nThey find the misfits or outcasts. Maybe 14 or 15 year old kids cutting school and sitting out in an abandoned lot smoking cigarettes. These kids don't usually have a solid family structure and racism is already kind of sown into their views of life. One day a guy pulls up in a Camaro. He has a shaved head a tattoos up and down his arms. This guy is 22 years old and to productive members of society looks like a total fuck up, but to these kids he looks pretty fucking bad ass. He can also buy beer.\n\nThese kids don't fit in anywhere, but this dude invites them to parties. Buys them beer, a pack of smokes, and generally becomes a big brother or father figure they never had. Now they have a sense of identity. They befriend more people in this group. They feel like they belong. So when all of their friends say "hey, we hate the Jews/blacks/gays." They say yeah, we fucking hate them too. Individually, they might be racist, but they might have had a black friend who wasn't so bad...except now they're part of this group, and they need to prove themselves.\n\nAs time passes they get into rougher and crueler territory. Violence, threats and a lot of other things they would have never done alone are happening because they need to prove themselves. They get married and all their hate group friends are there, even in the wedding. They have kids of their own and start to raise a family. Maybe they want to get out, but where are they going to go? All of their friends are in this hate filled group. They can't get a decent job because they didn't go to college (filled with a bunch of liberal homos), got a felony for beating a guy to an inch of his life, and have neck tattoos that claim white power (or Kill Whitey, depending on which side they're on). The ones that do get out put themselves and their families in physical danger because these are the kinds of people who don't take kindly to people turning their backs on them. \n\nSo they end up indoctrinating their kids into this, and the cycle continues.\n\nI don't condone any of this, but it really makes me pity the people who get wrapped up in this hate-fueled lifestyle knowing they never had the same chance a lot of us take for granted.	t5_2w844

Who cares of some of people involved were joking, especially since knowing 4chan they probably really are pissed about John Boyega, they just slightly exaggerated how pissed they are. To use another analogy, if you go to tea party rally and hold up an "Obama is a secret Muslim" sign not because you really believe it but because you think its funny how it pisses off liberals, what's the difference? You're still at a tea party rally holding a racist sign, you just feel slightly more smug about it.	t5_33oia

(aka content that the creator put into the game). And then remember how you guys made all those threads saying "Why boycotting Borderlands Pre-sequel is so important." and "Please do not buy Borderlands The Pre-Sequel." and "I wanted to direct you guys to 2K games PR email address, pr@2kgames.com (Gearbox won't care so lets focus on 2K)."\n\nYeah you guys are so much better than those SJWs who are trying to make games fail just because they have politics that offend them.	t5_33726

Everyone who says that we should just let them embarrass themselves by falling for the trolls clearly don't know how this works anymore. \n\nIt used to be that people would take the bait and then look stupid. \n\nBut it seems like now people have realized that if they just don't blink and keep pretending that it's real, nobody will catch on that they've been fooled. \n\nIt's just like how everyone I know thinks that gamergate hates women. \n\nFor starters, where is the proof that this is a troll tag and how do we get that out there?\n	t5_33726
cw6gdf7	Cadfan17	\N	> But this time, the complaint is basically that the women and/or black people have too much representation, at the cost of giving too little prominence to white, male characters. \n\nFrom reading your outrage culture link, the complaint seems to be that feminists think they're *Erin Brokovich*, but their critics think they're *Captain Planet.*\n\nInterpreting this as "too much representation [for women/black people]" while signal boosting a troll hashtag and articles about the troll hashtag from the Mary Sue, while not seeming to recognize the deep irony in submitting approving links to some place called "best of outrage culture" while *objectively participating in outrage culture at a higher level than those you're opposing...* kind of makes it understandable why people might see your movement that way. 	t5_3441a
cw5mk94	None	\N	I think in case of this particular hashtag it might be because of the comments of the director:\n\n>We wrote these characters but when we went to cast it, one of the things I had felt, having been to the Emmys a couple times — you look around that room and you see the whitest fucking room in the history of time. Its just unbelievably white. And I just thought, we’re casting this show and we have an opportunity to do anything we want, why not cast the show with actors of color? Like not for sure, and if we can’t find the actors who are great, we shouldn’t, but why don’t we make that effort because it wasn’t written that way and isnt that the cooler version of doing this as opposed to saying ‘this is an urban show’. It fucking kills me when they call something ‘an urban movie’ like its a separate thing, like ‘its that thing over there.’\n\nsource: http://www.slashfilm.com/star-wars-7-racially-diverse\n\nAbrams picked an extreme and people didn't like it, so my guess is that they picked an opposite extreme to counter it - and we got racism.	t5_2w844

cw6jii7	Cadfan17	\N	You characterized the linked arguments as I quoted. Your characterization appears to be inaccurate. There is a difference between objecting to the themes or content of a work, and objecting to the quality of a work, even if the issue of quality relates to the themes. \n\nFor example, if someone tells me that they have they have a new Christian Rock group they want to show me, I expect it will suck. But I have a lot of music saved on my computer by Christian groups writing about Christian themes, all of which I really enjoy. The difference is pretty simple. When I hear the words "Christian Rock" I expect to hear shitty music that sacrifices musical quality for purity of message, I expect the message to be about as subtle as a brick to the face, and I expect it's popularity among it's fans to be driven primarily by a mixture of in-group loyalty, and an almost sad desperation for media that panders very specifically to their world view. Not just media compatible with it- media that checks all the right boxes for them as much as possible. I expect this because I have decades of experience watching this social dynamic take place. Crappy music gets promoted in Christian Rock circles for ideological and tribalist reasons, and good music with Christian themes is rejected for insufficient ideological purity. At this point if I hear that a band is popular with or caters to the Christian Rock crowd, I expect the worst because that's what history has taught me. This is in spite of all the Christian music on my hard drive. It's not the themes that are the problem- it's the crappy community and it's neuroses. A Christian Rock fan might try to dismiss this paragraph by calling me anti Christian- I can virtually guarantee at least some would do that- but that doesn't mean a lot to me because that's pretty clearly as defensive reflex designed to preserve self image in the face of on point criticism. So that's their baggage. \n\nA lot of people see feminist engagement with media as embodying the same neuroses. You've linked some people who plainly do. They say so quite clearly. \n\nAnd you've done the standard. You've erased that portion if their argument and re-characterized it in accurately in irdervto avoid engaging with it. And you've sought out outrage peddling media outlets that professionally nutpick and attribute the results to society at large, to ensure that you can assure yourself that your re-characterization is an accurate reflection of what those you're criticizing *really* believe, so who cares if you had to put words into people's mouths to get there. \n\nIt's particularly a shame because there are enormous analogies to be the anti feminist response to feminist friendly media, and the feminist response to male gaze friendly media. Both involve making up bullshit objections to something benign and trying to justify them via incredibly questionable and unreasonably hostile arm chair psychology about both the way the media was created, and the reactions of the intended audience. Both arguments have the same strengths, and also the same weaknesses. But that's a grown up conversation that isn't happening with people who read the Mary Sue. 	t5_3441a

It's your typical anti-white (Too many whiteys) statement, and the concern is its another time where politics is more important than quality.\n\nIDK if Star Wars is going for political correctness. If I'm looking at it from strictly a business standpoint, Star Wars is one of the biggest IP brands in the world and I want those demographic dollars.  \n\n- Put a female in the "farmboy Luke" role, the female demo is going to relate to them easier PLUS I'll get SJWs singing my praises for being "progressive'. They try to pull that shit they pulled on Whedon, the rest of the rabid fanbase will tell them to go screw.\n\n- black guy in the Han Solo/Jedi in training Luke role?

cw6l3wa	Lightning_Shade	\N	https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3peexg/antigg_sjws_like_jay_allen_a_man_in_black_are/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3pekmk/sjws_on_twitter_are_trying_to_tie_gamergate_to/\n\nIn the thread you linked, siding against Mary Sue is not the same as siding for the stupid hashtag. The thing is "why are they linking us together, we aren't related", nothing else. This is an important distinction that you're not making.\n\nRead the comments on my links and yours and you'll find plenty of people condemning the tag.\n\n> What's notable to me is that this criticism being levied at the Star Wars film, that it gives insufficient representation to white men, embodies many elements of what GamerGate supporters and many others claim to hate about feminist or "SJW" criticism. It carries a seemingly obsessive focus on gender and race, rather than on "objective" criteria like acting and cinematography, or more politically neutral questions like "is it fun to watch?" It's an accusation made on moral or social grounds rooted in a political agenda. It constitutes social pressure (including a declared boycott) being applied to studios in an attempt to get them to change their film, remove problematic elements, or otherwise prevent them from making the film that they want to make. As far as I can tell, by whatever standards GGers have used in the past to justify accusing "SJWs" of attempting censorship, this is absolutely an attempt at censorship.\n\nThing is, the whole idea is so fucking stupid that we didn't even get to the "it's an attempt at censorship" because it's obviously stupid even _before_ that argument.\n\nAnd yeah, the tag seems to be a giant troll.\n\n> In what ways is this criticism being made against the Star Wars film different from the feminist criticism that typically gets made regarding sexism/racism/etc. in video games, comics, films, and other media?\n\nI can't believe I'm saying this, but even the worst of feminist criticism is usually less dumb, except for _very_ special circumstances.\n\n> In what ways are the two types of criticism the same?\n\nEverything you've said, obsessive focus on irrelevant factors with a pro-censorious streak.\n\n> Do you oppose or support one of these types of criticism? Both? Neither? Why?\n\nI oppose both. You have already stated the reasons.\n\n> If #BoycottStarWarsVII was a hashtag started by a feminist in anger over the poster giving too much prominence to a white male character rather than black or female ones, how do you think GamerGate or KiA would have reacted?\n\nThere would be more posts and we would talk about it more because it's closer to one of GG's "focus" points. Everything else would remain the same -- GG is already condemning the hell out of this tag and disassociating itself from it.	t5_3441a

cw6av8c	Youareabadperson6	\N	A bunch of people seem to be missing this, either that or they simply don't know. There was already a movement to boycott the new Star Wars film because it ignores and pretty much ret cons all of the expanded universe material created. All of it just out the window. Now called "Star Wars Legends" they are pretty much done expanding the old cannon and are just going to let it die off. That's one of the reasons I won't be seeing the movie, because they basically shit on decades of my childhood and fandom, so they can go fuck themselves. 	t5_33726

cw6nmmq	Lightning_Shade	\N	Eh, first of all, sometimes laughing at someone else's stupid makes for good schadenfreude. I think that's what some people in GG do.\n\nSecond, the fact that the mods have created a specific flair "TWITTER BULLSHIT", I think it's pretty clear what the overall idea is. Post it, if you want to, but it's nothing to be taken super-seriously.\n\nThird, having the option, people always, _always_ go for the low-hanging fruit. Which is unfortunate, but is human nature.	t5_3441a
cw8wib4	HariMichaelson	\N	If there is one to earmark, it would be that one. I promise you, Stover's books are an aberration, even among the good ones like Zahn and Luceno. He's far and away the greatest author that the Star Wars EU has ever had.	t5_33726
cw5swt3	Killgraft	\N	If you look at the /r/movies thread for the poster, there was a fair amount of bitching about the "**SJW AGENDA**" since it has a girl and black dude as the leads, so yea nothing surprises me anymore. 	t5_2qi4s

cw79buc	AnarchySealion	\N	That's the thing, there are very concentrated insane places on the internet with absolutely bonker ideas, and which can't be discerned from actual jokes or not (see: Poe's Law).\n\nThere are thousands of pages of 'unironical' posts about the illuminati, astronaut aliens and theories of how all modern medicine is a lie, how males cannot be infected by HIV if not by anal sex, etc... and those crazies overlap square and center with those racists.\n\nDoesn't mean it has any relation to real world racism, these people aren't representative of any real life demographic, they are just the craziest people who thanks to the internet can gather from all over the world.\n\nIf you have to report on them, this context is very important and not checking that it was the source, distorts completely the meaning of the piece to a very concerning level.	t5_33oia
cw68sl8	ManwardHo	\N	What makes you think that /tv/ is any less serious about it than /pol/?	t5_2rd2l
cw67lfy	Brrieck	\N	By the standards which make SJW propaganda, doesn't this technically mean that Alien*(1979)* and anything that suggests that women or non-white people exist/have agency in their own stories is social justice? I thought that racism had been solved because Black President happened and reasons - so by that logic this should just be a natural feature/expectation of society and not some kind of malicious pandering to a political demographic. But of course those whiley *leftists* are racists for not calling it out as a maniacally evil plot to introduce black characters into films made for everyone.	t5_2tzlb
cw6qx67	Lightning_Shade	\N	Alright, made the KIA post...\n\nThey don't really count it as censorship (for the most part) because it's more about a boycott and less about a demand to "change things". I had this in the back of my mind, but I forgot that when I wrote "I agree on that" or something like that without further clarification.\n\nIt's definitely trolling, though, and I'd agree that their reasons are irrelevant to the quality of the movie -- just like the reasons SJWs bring up in video games.	t5_3441a
cw5vvhh	IE_5	\N	Yeah, forced "diversity" sucks and I'm likely not going to watch it.\n\nBut more importantly, it was made by Disney and J.J. Abrams directed it. I've already seen how he destroyed Star Trek, I don't need to see how he destroy Star Wars too.	t5_33726
cw5lg2g	ThePrevailer	\N	To piggy back off this, since it's the most comprehensive, and least biased answer, racism is also a positive feedback loop to some extent. I grew up with a (white) kid who was pretty normal. We both had black and latino friends. Just generic middle America. My dad was military and we got shipped out when I was in middle school. \n\nWhen I came back to visit not two or three years later, he had gone American History X on me (although this was a few years before that came out.) He wasn't a skinhead, but the whole time I was there, he was complaining about the mexicans and the blacks. \n\nI asked him what the heck was up and when did this happen. His answer was that he was so sick of hearing about slavery and how bad black people had it and how it was "all the white man's fault, even though they (insert convoluted logic here)". He felt the civil rights lessons in school were guilt trips, and didn't like how the black kids in school talked about it. He thought they were being racist, etc.\n\nI never really hung out with him after that, but according to my mother who talked to his mom every once in a while for a few years after that, it was "just a phase" and he grew out of it. 	t5_2sokd

cw6dgqx	sje46	\N	I think a lot of it has to do with an oversensitivity to what is deemed an increasingly politically correct culture, an attitude actually perpetuated by the media itself even in kids television.  People react against that by being "edgy", and an attitude fosters that political correctness is hiding actual truths from society, everything from government intentions in foreign wars to god's existence to race.  So many people become "race realists", read more about the myth of races being equal, etc, and as they read more and talk to more people, the more they become outraged.  They start thinking that they're really the discriminated ones in society.\n\nI'm not saying the old way of race recruiting doesn't exist, but I do think the internet is breeding a different type of racist.	t5_2w844

cw6v5b1	floydwebb	\N	Wow. I am so trolled. I mean I have nothing to worry about. Here I am thinking that all the white supremacists that have signed on to the hashtag joke are serious and find out that there is nothing to worry about because 4Chan started it as a joke and #blackjedisnatter is an over reaction because racism is only as serious as you allow it to be.

cw5u4nt	Cawendaw	\N	There's probably several reasons why they do this, some of them sinister, some of them in common with non-extremist organizations.\n\n-If they're outside the mainstream, the people most likely to join them are the ones who aren't overly attached to remaining normal (i. e. people who are already outcasts)\n\n\n-Teenagers in general, and outcast teenagers in particular, are more likely than adults or popular teenagers to have a "question the mainstream" attitude towards things, and be more likely to entertain alternate (in this case extremist) narratives.  Relatedly, teenagers are more likely to be searching for identity (which the extremists can provide), whereas adults are more likely to already have one (and to have one that includes "I'm not literally a nazi" as a non-negotiable point)\n\n-The extremists think of themselves as good guys, and will target prospective members who they think will "benefit" most from joining them (lonely people, in other words)\n\n-They require a high level of commitment, and therefore seek out people who won't have any conflicting commitments (i.e. non-extremist friends or family)\n\n-If they're doing things that could be reported to the authorities, they'll want to pick people who are already wary of the authories, and/or are too young to have a lot of credibility if they do tattle.\n\n-They'd like to get high-powered middle age professionals if they could, but those people usually do more investigation into the thing they're thinking of joining than a lonely teenager, and when they do that they tend not to join.  So the extremists target lonely teenagers instead.\n\n-Alternately, if the group is very hierarchical, they might want to actively *avoid* new members who have enough social authority to overrule existing members.  A successful small businessman might make things uncomfortable for the existing extremist leaders ("Rank be damned!  We're doing it my way or no more free catering!"), while a lonely teenager definitely wouldn't.\n\n-After a long period of mostly recruiting lonely teenagers, doing so just becomes part of the extremist group's institutional culture.  Recruiters seek out potential members who resemble themselves when they joined, and if they started out as lonely teenagers, that's who they'll seek out.	t5_2w844

Star wars VII is neither of those two.	t5_33726
cw653pc	OmarLittlest_Petshop	\N	It's actually a pretty insightful, well written piece, imo\n\nLines up pretty well with the 'skinhead'-type white supremacists I've met (as a non-white person who hung out in a punk scene where there were a few racist skinheads).\n\nThey're a funny, complex bunch; most of the time they were falling over themselves to explain how I was "different to all those niggers" (actually they rarely used that kind of racial slurs around me, but that seemed to be the gist of what they were saying), I guess coz we had friends in common, and broadly similar taste in music. Or something. I have no doubt they'd treat me very different if we'd met under different circumstances.\n\nBut people get all 'white supremacist' for a bunch of different reasons.\n\nI think with younger people today, they probably don't see much of the kind of overt, undeniable, institutionalised racism that used to be more obvious, but they *do* see a Black man in the Whitehouse, super-rich 'privileged' Black celebs, etc. Yet they still hear about "White privilege" (a phrase guaranteed to piss people off) and that non-White groups are discriminated against.\n\nCombine this with limited personal experience, poor capacity for empathy, and an appealing ideology which recasts them from 'the villain' (a lot of people see 'white privilege' as an accusation) to "the *real* oppressed minority", and there is a kind of (flawed, ignorant) logic to their thinking.\n\nPeople love an ideology that frames them as the "poor, wronged victim." \n\nUsually they don't even *really* consider themselves 'racist'; they they're "just being honest", or something. And 90% of them kind of aren't *truly* 'racist' (in a way); *if* you can cut thru the bullshit rhetoric, they'll eventually treat you (regardless of race) as an individual. Very few people *truly* believe that ultimately, *all* [insert race] people are [insert stereotype], in spite of the reasonable, non-stereotype-fitting person in front of them. (of course this won't change their mind; you're just an exception to the stereotype, and now proof that they're "not really racist")\n\nIts all pretty weird and contradictory. I don't wanna sound like I'm excusing people's moronic belief systems, but I think 'calling out' people as 'white supremacists' or having 'white privilege' is rarely helpful, and usually just reinforces their beliefs. I hate to be all 'peace and love' but reasonable, non-preachy dialogue, is more likely to make people question their beliefs.	t5_2sokd

cw64262	NotTooDeep	\N	I think human beings are wired for racism as a quick survival mechanism; i.e. us and not us; our tribe and not our tribe.\n\nMy evidence for this comes partly from racial humor.  In every culture, there are jokes about a different race or culture.  For instance, I grew up in SoCal learning Polack Jokes.  The first time I spent a few days in Central California I heard the same jokes told by Hispanics but told about the Portuguese.  Portiggy jokes.\n\nAs an adult, I observed the Chinese telling similar jokes about the white Americans, the Japanese telling similar jokes about the Filipinos, etc.\n\nFor some reason, everyone needs to identify with one group and put down another group.  I know part of it might be genetically inherited, but then my white father was a bigot towards blacks and I never was. On vacations to the South, I didn't care if the water fountain was for whites or blacks, and I got spanked for it. So the bigotry isn't tied to race, but it's a strong drive in us to identify with one group and shun or punish another.  It's a baser human drive, and can be overcome through experience.\n\nMy father changed after a black man saved his life one night; they became friends.  I always wonder who he missed knowing all those years before.  	t5_2sokd

cw6nxdq	JaronK	\N	>In what ways is this criticism being made against the Star Wars film different from the feminist criticism that typically gets made regarding sexism/racism/etc. in video games, comics, films, and other media?\n\nWell, it's just straight up trolling.  I mean hell, one of Salon's examples was something like "would you want your daughter to marry a black stormtrooper"?  That's people trying to be funny.  So, that's the difference.\n\n>In what ways are the two types of criticism the same?\n\nSome people are extremist idiots on both sides, I guess?\n\n>Do you oppose or support one of these types of criticism? Both? Neither? Why?\n\nWell, I like the criticism that says that Hollywood is too whitewashed, because I used to work in the entertainment industry.  I've seen things like the director asking for random people resulting in the casting call being for white people only.  And there really are fewer primary roles written for women that are anything but romantic targets.  I'd like more variety there.  Meanwhile, the trolling thing is just trolling, so I don't care for that.\n\n>If #BoycottStarWarsVII was a hashtag started by a feminist in anger over the poster giving too much prominence to a white male character rather than black or female ones, how do you think GamerGate or KiA would have reacted?\n\nIf it was equally stupid, I imagine they'd point that out.	t5_3441a

So the only thing that happened as a result of this is people started talking about how that shit's not okay, and the dumb racist people got to express their dumb racist opinions.

Attacking a more powerful enemy is higher priority.\n\n> But do you agree that it is in fact "an attempt at censorship", at least by the standards by which KiA/GG accuses "SJWs" of censorship?\n\nYes, I do. Absolutely.\n\n> How do you think KiA/GG would have reacted if it was a feminist making the gender/race-flipped version of that criticism (you know what I mean) against the Star Wars film?\n\nCondemn it. Only it would be longer and more noticeable for reasons I outlined above.\n\n> GGers frequently declare that they're opposed to this sort of censorship or moral authoritarianism or cultural invasion or whatever in tech and geek spaces.\n\nYeah.\n\n> So I'm not impressed that, when the "incursion" comes from someone other than their hated SJWs, they thought to defend their own reputation rather than the iconic sci-fi franchise being attacked.\n\nI'll make a separate KIA post asking about opinions on whether this counts as SJW-like censorship. I do think GG will agree with that, but we'll see.\n\nWhat I meant here is that "it's dumb" is the first step, "it's pro-censorious" is the second. We have basically dismissed it as idiocy on the _first_ step and moved on. It's difficult to _keep_ thinking _after_ dismissing something and, thus, removing it from your mind. Dismissing feminist criticism is a bit more difficult because it has actual media recognition, so we have enough time to think through to the second step.	t5_3441a

cw6l0ic	SpawnPointGuard	\N	It's not "criticism" or "censorship," it's trolling.  This was an incredibly effective troll campaign to make a bunch of people outraged over absolutely nothing. It plays into the need for losers to feel morally superior to some no-name idiot on the Internet.  The pathetic clickbait "progressive" media took no time whatsoever to look into this and, surprise to no one, has now made asses of themselves by taking trolls seriously and deeply analyzing what trolls have to say.  The one unfortunate part is that they're so hopelessly inept that they'll never even realize their blunder.  The Guardian even called them "trolls," but they meant it in the clueless, Pulitzer Prize-winning media sort of way where the definition is "some jerk on the Internet."  So that's why GamerGate doesn't care about condemning a few trolls from 4chan who weren't sincere to begin with and managed to bait our enemies into once again showing how pathetic their reporting skills are.	t5_3441a

"Outrage" can be whatever they want it to mean.  They are so dependent upon this "outrage" for lulz, and they are dependent upon the lulz to justify to themselves that it's "not necessarily racist".  So for this entire thing to work, they need to convince themselves that people are **outraged** and not merely annoyed.

cw635kk	PointNShooty	\N	That's my point. It's **always** acceptable for a white man to be in video games. But whenever a minority or female character is included people accuse it of being "forced diversity" or "affirmative action in video games" or "why did they have to be black/a woman?" or "this is just pandering to whatever crowd" or "what's the justification for this character for being part of this demographic?" or "well the series has only had white and male characters in the past and I can't believe they're changing that".\n\nGG likes to act "well I mean it could go either way" but can you seriously ever think of an example where GG said "ugh, I can't believe they're making the main character a straight white dude. Classic pandering to 'gamers'. Seriously, like i'm fine with white men in video games but i hate it when the devs are forced to put this kind of character in games.

cw68q3h	meheleventyone	\N	> In what ways is this criticism being made against the Star Wars film different from the feminist criticism that typically gets made regarding sexism/racism/etc. in video games, comics, films, and other media?\n\nIn general complaints about diversity in films by feminists and others is about films at large rather than specific movies. This differs because the complaints are about a specific movie which although it seemingly gives a backseat to white men doesn't really alter the balance in movies at large. Basically the reaction to this trailer is essentially the straw man that GG likes to pretend "SJWs" believe about diversity.\n\n> In what ways are the two types of criticism the same?\n\nIn ways too trivial to be interesting to discuss.\n\n> Do you oppose or support one of these types of criticism? Both? Neither? Why?\n\nIt's hard to support criticism about diversity that isn't self-aware enough to see the broader picture.

There are black actors trying to land roles in Hollywood, but movies don't really reflect that population. Movies cast for the "best person for the role," but often that idea of the "best person" is white because it's safer. Casting the best person regardless of race is representing the population of minority actors.\n\nI don't know if that made sense.	t5_2qi4s

Stop being divisive.\n\nI'm not interested in Twitter boycotts, but let's not pretend there is anything remotely racist about this hashtag (it's apparently a troll thing anyway).

And how the representation of women is bad. Plus, we've never had a female jedi main character, this would have been the perfect opportunity.
