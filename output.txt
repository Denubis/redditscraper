  "Anyone remember #INeedMasculism?A while back, some guys from the MRM got #INeedMasculism trending on Twitter, using it to discuss the unique problems they face in society as men.  Of course, the Twitter feminists couldn't leave well enough alone, so they decided to hijack it and mock the shit out of it.  Believe it or not, they're *still* keeping that hashtag going, because apparently the joke hasn't gotten old yet.\n\nKind of puts their whining about men 'hijacking' #YesAllWomen into perspective, doesn't it?"),

  "Something that a lot of people don't realize is that there *is* currently a lack of spaces in societies where people can discuss men's issues. What's worse, is when people do try to create these spaces, they're stigmatized and--dare I say it--oppressed. People should be able to express themselves, and [NeuroticIntrovert has a great post that goes into much greater detail here](http://np.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1jt1u5/cmv_i_think_that_mens_rights_issues_are_the/cbi2m7a), where he steps through how this became such an issue today.\n\nWe should really be promoting an environment that allows *everyone* to express their own views and perspectives. #YesAllWomen is a great movement that carries enough social capital that a lot of women can express the frustrations and injustices that they experience every day. #YesAllMen is important for the same reason--we can't work together on a solution unless we know where each other is coming from."))

If men were in power, you'd think our movement would have huge success. If we're the powerful gender here, why aren't all the men backing us up? It should be extremely obvious to them that *they are the ones in power here*, because they are the ones who hold all the support.

  "Anyone remember #INeedMasculism?A while back, some guys from the MRM got #INeedMasculism trending on Twitter, using it to discuss the unique problems they face in society as men.  Of course, the Twitter feminists couldn't leave well enough alone, so they decided to hijack it and mock the shit out of it.  Believe it or not, they're *still* keeping that hashtag going, because apparently the joke hasn't gotten old yet.\n\nKind of puts their whining about men 'hijacking' #YesAllWomen into perspective, doesn't it?"),

  "Something that a lot of people don't realize is that there *is* currently a lack of spaces in societies where people can discuss men's issues. What's worse, is when people do try to create these spaces, they're stigmatized and--dare I say it--oppressed. People should be able to express themselves, and [NeuroticIntrovert has a great post that goes into much greater detail here](http://np.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1jt1u5/cmv_i_think_that_mens_rights_issues_are_the/cbi2m7a), where he steps through how this became such an issue today.\n\nWe should really be promoting an environment that allows *everyone* to express their own views and perspectives. #YesAllWomen is a great movement that carries enough social capital that a lot of women can express the frustrations and injustices that they experience every day. #YesAllMen is important for the same reason--we can't work together on a solution unless we know where each other is coming from."))

   "Anyone remember #INeedMasculism?A while back, some guys from the MRM got #INeedMasculism trending on Twitter, using it to discuss the unique problems they face in society as men.  Of course, the Twitter feminists couldn't leave well enough alone, so they decided to hijack it and mock the shit out of it.  Believe it or not, they're *still* keeping that hashtag going, because apparently the joke hasn't gotten old yet.\n\nKind of puts their whining about men 'hijacking' #YesAllWomen into perspective, doesn't it?"),

   "Something that a lot of people don't realize is that there *is* currently a lack of spaces in societies where people can discuss men's issues. What's worse, is when people do try to create these spaces, they're stigmatized and--dare I say it--oppressed. People should be able to express themselves, and [NeuroticIntrovert has a great post that goes into much greater detail here](http://np.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1jt1u5/cmv_i_think_that_mens_rights_issues_are_the/cbi2m7a), where he steps through how this became such an issue today.\n\nWe should really be promoting an environment that allows *everyone* to express their own views and perspectives. #YesAllWomen is a great movement that carries enough social capital that a lot of women can express the frustrations and injustices that they experience every day. #YesAllMen is important for the same reason--we can't work together on a solution unless we know where each other is coming from.")))
