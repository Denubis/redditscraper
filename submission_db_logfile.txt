             'Selftext': u'There\'s been a small bit of controversy lately surrounding the upcoming film *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*, relating to how women and black people are portrayed and represented in the film (or at least in the official promotional materials that have been released). But this time, the complaint is basically that the women and/or black people have *too much* representation, at the cost of giving too little prominence to white, male characters. Some of the drama is documented (and of course, mocked) in /r/BestOfOutrageCulture [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/BestOfOutrageCulture/comments/3pcdbo/i_just_feel_like_men_are_losing_their_shit_women/) and [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/BestOfOutrageCulture/comments/3pdebq/star_wars_the_outrage_awakens_smorgasbord_ehh_i/), and in /r/SubredditDrama [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3p9z7h/argument_in_rmovies_about_star_wars_casting/). But there\'s been some buzz outside of reddit as well; the hashtag #BoycottStarWarsVII popped up on Twitter, eliciting comment from outlets like [The Mary Sue](http://www.themarysue.com/boycott-star-wars-vii-because-why-again/), [Salon](http://www.salon.com/2015/10/19/racists_threaten_to_boycott_star_wars_vii_because_it_promotes_white_genocide_apparently/), and [The Hollywood Reporter](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/boycott-star-wars-vii-movement-833102), among others.\n\nWhat\'s notable to me is that this criticism being levied at the Star Wars film, that it gives insufficient representation to white men, embodies many elements of what GamerGate supporters and many others claim to hate about feminist or "SJW" criticism. It carries a seemingly obsessive focus on gender and race, rather than on "objective" criteria like acting and cinematography, or more politically neutral questions like "is it fun to watch?" It\'s an accusation made on moral or social grounds rooted in a political agenda. It constitutes social pressure (including a declared boycott) being applied to studios in an attempt to get them to change their film, remove problematic elements, or otherwise prevent them from making the film that they want to make. As far as I can tell, by whatever standards GGers have used in the past to justify accusing "SJWs" of attempting censorship, this is absolutely an attempt at censorship.\n\nAnd yet I haven\'t heard a single word from GamerGaters decrying this criticism. The only post I\'ve seen in KiA on this topic is [this one](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3pf00a/ethics_a_whole_three_people_tweet/), and it sides *against* one of the outlets that have criticized the backlash. As a matter of fact, some of the criticism against the film actually sound a lot like what GGers have been saying over the past year, particularly the anger towards "SJWs" and political correctness, and possessiveness over parts of popular culture. If any GGer anywhere has pushed back against the boycotters and other complainants for being moral authoritarians or trying to censor the film, I haven\'t seen it.\n\nDiscussion questions:\n\n* In what ways is this criticism being made against the Star Wars film different from the feminist criticism that typically gets made regarding sexism/racism/etc. in video games, comics, films, and other media?\n\n* In what ways are the two types of criticism the same?\n\n* Do you oppose or support one of these types of criticism? Both? Neither? Why?\n\n* If #BoycottStarWarsVII was a hashtag started by a feminist in anger over the poster giving too much prominence to a white male character rather than black or female ones, how do you think GamerGate or KiA would have reacted?\n\nEDIT: A lot of this also applies to the [conservative backlash](http://www.cinemablend.com/television/Watch-Fox-News-Slam-Captain-America-Targeting-Conservatives-93287.html) against [Captain America](http://comicsalliance.com/conservatives-vs-captain-america/), if you\'d rather talk about that instead.',
